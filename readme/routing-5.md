- One of the most important concepts in web frameworks is routing.

  Here's the address. a.com here is called a domain name.
And the part called dashboard analytics is called path in English.
And each element that makes up the path is called a segment.

Routing means that certain content is grouped in a certain way according to that path.
Deciding what to show is called routing.
  Now let's take a look at next.js routing.
The most basic rule is: Now we connected without a pass behind us.
Now, what I'm saying is that you came to the homepage. Now, at this time, NeXT js looks for page.js under the app folder.


The final result created by combining the page.js return value with the children of layout.js
HTML will be responded.

  Now, this time, let's click create here. Now, create is included after the pass.

  A 404 error occurred because we had not taken any action on the page yet.

As for how to respond to content, here is Pass Create.

Now, we create a folder called create under the app. And the promised name is page.js.
